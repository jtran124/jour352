            <h2>The Melting of "Chocolate City": Displacement of People, Culture (By Jade A. Tran) </h2>
            <p>“Chocolate City” was its nickname. No, it wasn’t a reference to its architecture or an abundance of
                chocolate shops, but to its majority Black population in the 1970s. Many know it beyond its 1970s
                nickname, popularized by the P-funk band Parliament in the hit song Chocolate City, as “The District” or
                simply Washington, D.C., as it's written on any map.</p>

            <p>“I grew up hearing so many nostalgic stories about Chocolate City,” said Daija Brisbon, a D.C. native and
                DCPS educator.</p>

            <p>In the 1970s, Black residents made up 70% of the population. Now, the once “Chocolate City” has melted,
                with the Black population dropping to around 40%.</p>

            <p>Where did the Black residents go? The answer lies in gentrification.</p>

            <p>Gentrification refers to the transformation of historically less affluent urban areas as wealthier
                individuals and families move in. This rapid influx often brings upscale businesses unfamiliar to the
                neighborhood, rising property taxes, and increasing costs for everyday necessities. According to a
                National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) study, “an influx of investment and changes to the
                built environment leads to rising home values, family incomes and educational levels of residents.”</p>

            <p>While that may be the textbook definition, the real-world consequences reveal a much harsher truth, often
                forcing out longtime residents—particularly Black residents and other people of color. Many are left
                with no choice but to leave their homes and relocate to more affordable cities in surrounding states
                like Maryland.</p>

            <p>For years, D.C. held the title of the most gentrified city in the country. But why D.C.?</p>

            <p>Jesse Van Tol, CEO of NCRC, traces the city’s rapid gentrification back to the Great Recession, when
                D.C.’s economy was booming, and wealthier people began to move back into urban areas centers.</p>

            <p>Dr. Jeanette Snider, an assistant research professor in the sociology department at the University of
                Maryland specializing in social justice, anti-Black racism, and critical race theory, views this process
                as inherently inequitable.</p>

            <p> “It is literally pulling people out of the community that they live in, and it’s fundamentally wrong,”
                Snider said. “There’s this premise that these specific groups who already live there, who already
                created communities there, don’t want or need or deserve.”</p>

            <p>Snider compared modern gentrification to South Africa’s historical apartheid. Much like the government
                displaced Black people once their areas became desirable, a similar pattern is unfolding in cities like
                D.C.</p>

            <p>As a 48-year-old Washingtonian, Sharlette Sneed has seen gentrification firsthand. It often arrives in
                the form of higher-end grocery stores like Whole Foods, along with coffee shops and yoga studios on
                prominent corners.</p>

            <div class="text-center my-4">

            </div>

            <p>For many longtime residents, these cosmetic changes, such as new shops and revitalized streets, are
                jarring. They often coincide with an influx of predominantly white residents, sparking questions
                about why such luxurious amenities are introduced only after a shift in neighborhood demographics.</p>

            <p>“They like nice things too,” Snider said. “It’s odd to me that it’s only when certain communities and
                folks start to move into those communities, it’s like, ‘Okay, now we’re going to start to build
                these grocery stores so we don’t live in food deserts.’”</p>

            <p>This trend is counterintuitive, Snider added, noting that Black people are among the top consumers of
                various services and products in America’s economy. From a capitalist standpoint, she argued,
                investing in Black neighborhoods makes economic sense.</p>

            <p>Gentrification doesn’t just displace residents—it also erases the culture, arts, and identity of
                those who leave. Walking through the capital, you might passively notice the absence of Go-Go music
                on the streets or hear music ending before the sun goes down.</p>

            <p>“This store would play Go-Go music loud, but that was the culture of the neighborhood,” said Sneed.
                “Well, the new people in the neighborhood, the white people, they didn’t understand the culture, and
                so that neighborhood started to change.”</p>

            <p>That store was a Metro PCS store near Howard University, located on a corner in the Shaw
                neighborhood, and became a flashpoint of controversy in 2019. T-Mobile, the store’s corporate owner,
                ordered staff to turn off their go-go music after a newcomer in a nearby luxury apartment building
                complained. The
                request sparked outrage and kickstarted the #DontMuteDC mass campaign, with thousands signing a
                petition, urging T-Mobile to restore the city’s music.</p>

            <p>Go-Go, which originated in D.C., during the era of its “Chocolate City” nickname, is both a
                cornerstone of the city’s culture as well as a city staple. Artists like Chuck Brown, James Funk,
                and others brought the genre to life, cementing their status as relics of a bygone era of excellence.
            </p>

            <p>The genre, well-known for its Afro-Caribbean and funk fusion, produces a distinct sound often echoed
                on D.C. street corners by residents playing drums. But, Go-Go is more than music; it has been a vital
                outlet for vibrant self-expression as well as addressing the struggles of Black life in the city.</p>

            <p>In 2020, following the outcry over the Metro PCS controversy, Mayor Muriel Bowser declared Go-Go the
                official music of the capital in an attempt to preserve the city’s sound.</p>

            <p>“And it's just like, you know, you were born and raised here, [they’re] trying to tell me about my
                city. I'm from here,” Sneed said.</p>

            <p>The illustrious Howard University, a historically Black university, sits in neighborhoods—Shaw and U
                Street—that the National Public Radio (NPR) considers highly gentrified. In 1980, these
                neighborhoods were bustling with Black residents, who made up 80% of the area’s population. By 2010,
                that number had dwindled to 30%, according to The Washington City Paper—a shift that unfolded steps away
                from the
                mecca of Black excellence.</p>

            <p>Sneed described how gentrification disrupts the traditions of Howard’s campus, particularly those
                tied to The Yard, Howard’s iconic quad. For over a century, The Yard—a quadrangle of mowed grass and
                sidewalks surrounded by academic buildings—has hosted everything from Greek Life spectacles, the
                famous “YardFest” music festival, and speeches by coveted figures such as Nelson Mandela, Vice President
                Kamala
                Harris, and Oprah Winfrey.</p>

            <p>Yet newcomers, unfamiliar with these traditions, walk their dogs carelessly through decades of
                history.</p>

            <p>“They’re talking about white people walking across the lawn at Howard, you know, not understanding
                that culture on The Yard,” Sneed said. “[They’re] walking their dogs, letting their dogs use the
                bathroom, you know, on that type of space.”</p>

            <p>While the university doesn’t explicitly prohibit dogs, students consider The Yard sacred ground.
                Sneed emphasized that The Yard is central to Howard’s culture, particularly for fraternities and
                sororities, which adhere to strict etiquette around the space.</p>

            <p>Gentrification is not just a displacer or disruptor—it disconnects communities, severing ties to the
                cultures and roots that once defined them. Without an effort to preserve these roots, nostalgia may
                be all that remains of D.C.’s “Chocolate City.”</p>

            <p>“In the ‘80s and ‘90s, people gathered in the community for Go-Go’s, cook-outs, sports like the
                annual Turkey Bowl football game, [and] cabarets to celebrate,” Brisbon said.</p>

            <p>While neighborhood investment is vital for a city’s growth, it should not sacrifice people or
                culture. The nostalgia Brisbon describes shouldn’t be all that remains; the stories and traditions of
                D.C.’s
                Black community deserve to live on beyond the present.</p>

            <p>“As a 29-year-old, I feel that I benefit from the diversity that has been introduced to the city but,
                I often wonder how it feels for the black community that doesn't,” Brisbon said.</p>
